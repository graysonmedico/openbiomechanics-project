# 1. Define your links here (REMOVED PARENTHESES)
my_links <- list(
  github   = "https://github.com/graysonmedico",
  linkedin = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/grayson-medico-491ab7381/",
  email    = "mailto:graysonmedico@gmail.com",
  x        = "https://X.com/graysonmedico"
)

# 2. Define the Custom "Field Theme" CSS
css_style <- "
<style>
.btn-field {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 10px;
  background-color: #2E5A38; /* Outfield Green */

# 3. Create the HTML for the buttons
buttons_html <- div(

# 4. Render it
cat(css_style)
# FIX: Use as.character() and cat() to ensure clean HTML output
cat(as.character(buttons_html))

## Bridging the Gap Between "Feel" and "Real"
<br>
Baseball has always been filled with traditional wisdom—cues and mechanics that have been passed down for decades. But as a player, I often found myself asking: Is this actually true? Or is it just what we’ve always been told?

I created this project to find those answers.

## The Mission
<br>
My goal was to take high-level, open-source biomechanics data and make it accessible. I wanted to move beyond the guesswork and see the actual correlations that drive velocity, health, and efficiency on the mound.

**As a Player:** I wanted to make more informed decisions about my own training, understanding how my body moves and how to optimize it for peak performance.

**As a Coach:** I wanted to ensure that the advice I give isn’t just repetition, but rooted in fact. This project allows me to help other athletes develop faster and safer.





## Powered by Open Data
<br>
This analysis utilizes data from the OpenBiomechanics Project, a revolutionary open-source initiative that provides high-fidelity motion capture data to the public. By leveraging this resource, we can democratize access to elite-level sports science, proving that you don't need a million-dollar lab to learn the truth about the game.
