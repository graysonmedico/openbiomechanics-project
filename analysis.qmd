### The Hypothesis
**Conventional baseball wisdom suggests that:**
The farther you stride the harder you will throw. Is that true?
<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# 1. Load Data
df <- read_csv("data/pitcher_profiles.csv")

# 2. Calculate Stats
r_val <- cor(df$stride_length, df$pitch_speed_mph, use = "complete.obs")
avg_stride <- mean(df$stride_length, na.rm = TRUE)
avg_velo   <- mean(df$pitch_speed_mph, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3. Create the Professional Plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = stride_length, y = pitch_speed_mph)) +
  
  # A. The Crosshairs (Quadrant Lines)
  geom_vline(xintercept = avg_stride, linetype="dotted", color="grey60") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = avg_velo, linetype="dotted", color="grey60") +
  
  # B. The Data Points (with Hover Text)
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("<b>Pitcher:</b>", user, 
                              "<br><b>Stride:</b>", round(stride_length, 2), "%",
                              "<br><b>Velo:</b>", pitch_speed_mph, "mph")), 
             color = "#2980b9", alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +
  
  # C. The Trend Line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", linetype = "dashed", se = FALSE) +
  
  # D. Labels & Theme
  labs(
    title = paste0("Stride Length vs. Velocity (r = ", round(r_val, 2), ")"),
    x = "Stride Length (% of Body Height)",
    y = "Velocity (MPH)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

# 4. Make it Interactive
ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
```

# The Analysis

*This chart tests that theory by comparing Stride Length directly against Pitch Velocity.*

The Variables
X-Axis: Stride Length (% of Height)

What it is: The distance from the pitching rubber to where the lead foot lands at ground contact.

How it is measured: In biomechanics, this is often tracked as a percentage of the pitcher's body height (e.g., a 6'0" pitcher striding 6 feet has a 100% stride length).

The Norm: Most MLB pitchers stride between 80% and 105% of their body height.

Y-Axis: Pitch Velocity (mph)

What it is: The maximum speed of the ball at release.

**The Theory:** If the "longer stride" myth is true, we should see a clear upward line—pitchers who stride farther should consistently throw harder.

## How to Read This Graph
The "Goldilocks" Zone: You will likely notice that the hardest throwers don't always have the longest strides. They sit in a middle range that allows their hips to rotate fully.

The "Over-Striders": Look for dots on the far right (extreme stride length) that might have lower velocity. When a pitcher strides too far, their hips can get "locked out," preventing them from rotating quickly and killing their power.

The "Short-Striders": Dots on the far left represent pitchers who cut their delivery short. While this can limit energy generation, some elite short-closers use this effectively for deception.

# The Takeaway
Stride Length is an Output, Not an Input. The data suggests that stride length is personal to the athlete's hip mobility and strength. Forcing a pitcher to stride farther than their body allows can actually decrease velocity by disrupting their timing. The goal isn't "maximum distance"—it's "optimal distance" to allow the pelvis to rotate powerfully.
## Parameters of Research
<br>
Stride length is calculated from the rubber to the back of the front foot. It is shown as a percent of the athletes height. (0.7 = 70% of height)
